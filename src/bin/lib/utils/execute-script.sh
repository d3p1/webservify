# Execute script
#
# @param  string $1 Script path
# @param  string $2 Script params
# @return void
# @note   In reality, the `shift` command and
#         the `@` symbol (as a rest operator) are used to retrieve
#         script parameters. Consequently, every argument
#         following the `$1` parameter (script path) is treated as part of `$2`,
#         and will be used as a script parameter
##
execute_script() {
    local script

    ##
    # @note It is used "dot space script" calling syntax 
    #       (it is like `source` command), so it is used current shell to
    #       execute the script (and it is not created a sub-shell).
    #       It is not possible to use the `exec` command because this command
    #       replace main shell script (instead of reusing it), so when the
    #       executed script tries to return to main shell script, it does not
    #       exist and the script terminates unexpectedly
